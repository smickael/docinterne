# Deploy your site

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
yarn build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
yarn serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at `http://localhost:3000/`.

You can now deploy the `build` folder **easily**.
